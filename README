To run the code, the user needs to have the packages MonoPoly and Rsymphony installed in R.
The code can analyse a data set provided by the user or can simulate its own.
In the former case, the csv file containing the data set must be copied  in the same directory as the file “budget.R”. In the data file, the ranks of the committee member are reported in the column and the initiatives run through the rows. The first column contain the initiative names, the first row the committee IDs and the cell (1,1) must be left empty. The name of the csv file should be indicated in the first two lines of the code.
If the data have to be generated by the program, the first few lines of the code contain a few parameters that can be changed.

To run the code, copy the file budget.R (and possibly the data file) in a folder, run R and set the working directory to that folder. Then just source the file “budget.R”, i.e. write source(“budget.R”).
